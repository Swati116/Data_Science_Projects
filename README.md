# Data_Science_Projects
I'm a data enthusiast passionate about turning raw information into meaningful insights. With hands-on experience in Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, I build dashboards and data models that solve real-world problems across education, healthcare, and environmental domains.
**Students Social Media Addiction Dashboard (Excel) :** Analyzed behavioral trends among 300+ students from 50+ countries. Built an interactive Excel dashboard to explore addiction scores, sleep patterns, and mental health indicators.
**Clinical Trial Data Analysis (MySQL) :** Designed a relational database for clinical trial data and wrote advanced SQL queries to uncover patient participation and medication trends.
**Global Air Pollution Dashboard (Power BI):** Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize pollution metrics (PM2.5, AQI) across countries and years. Enabled dynamic filtering and regional comparisons.
**Emergency Room Visits Dashboard (Tableau) :** Used Tableau to analyze ER visit patterns, patient demographics, and departmental referrals. Delivered insights to support healthcare operations.
